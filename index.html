        <p id ="madLib" > There once was a dog named Leo. Leo was <span class="spanClass" id="adjectiveOneSpan">  </span> bored and hungry,
             so he jumped his fence and went to the park. At the park, he decided to do some 
             <span class="spanClass" id="verbOneSpan">  </span> for a while, 
             and then he went to the <span class="spanClass" id="nounOneSpan">  </span>. He then realized he was so so 
             <span class="spanClass" id="adjectiveTwoSpan"> </span> energetic and excited. He just had to go do some 
          <span class="spanClass" id="verbTwoSpan"> </span> immediately, and then go make some <span class="spanClass" id="nounTwoSpan"> </span>. 
          After he was finished it was obvious that he was <span class="spanClass" id="adjectiveThreeSpan"> </span> and completely out of his element.
          It was time to go<span class="spanClass" id="verbThreeSpan"> </span>. How could he even begin to use the <span class="spanClass" id="nounThreeSpan"> </span> 
          without first understanding it? It would be <span class="spanClass" id="adjectiveFourSpan"> </span> Impossible. Then he had an
          incredible idea! He would go home and do some <span class="spanClass" id="verbFourSpan"> </span>. That would solve everything!
         So he went home and went straight to the <span class="spanClass" id="nounFourSpan"> </span> and was soon totally satisfied. It
        had been a good day for Leo, one he would never forget. <div id="the-End">THE END</div> </p>
